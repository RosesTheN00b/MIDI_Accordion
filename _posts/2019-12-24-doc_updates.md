Hiyo,

It's been a long time coming, but I finally got around to finishing and uploading detailed pages on setting up the MIDI Accordion's Bluetooth and pressure sensors.  Thanks to denia85 for [opening an issue](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion/issues/5) asking for more documentation around the pressure sensor, which was just the kick I needed to get this done. You can check these pages out here:

- [Bluetooth Configuration](http://bvavra.github.io/MIDI_Accordion/bluetooth/)
- [Portable Power Supply](http://bvavra.github.io/MIDI_Accordion/power/)
- [Dynamic Volume: Pressure Sensor Configuration](http://bvavra.github.io/MIDI_Accordion/volume/)

If anyone needs any clarification on these (or any other) pages, or if you have any other questions on the proejct, please feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion/issues/new) and I will do my best to address it.
